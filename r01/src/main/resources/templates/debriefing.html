                <h3>Effectiveness of interpretation training to reduce anxiety: Evaluating technology-based delivery
                    models and methods to reduce attrition</h3>


                <p>We are currently investigating experimental approaches to reduce anxiety. The experimental
                    approaches used in the study are based on models of anxiety, which have shown that anxious people
                    tend to interpret ambiguous situations as threatening. It has been proposed that the tendency to
                    interpret things in a threatening way plays a role in the onset of, and recovery from, anxiety
                    problems.
                </p>

                <p>In the current study, we are evaluating if it is possible to change interpretation patterns over the
                    Internet, and whether changing these interpretation patterns will reduce anxiety symptoms. We are
                    also testing whether we can identify people at risk of dropping out of the study and provide them
                    a personal coach to encourage them to stay in the study. Finally, we are examining whether
                    participants obtain different results by completing the intervention on their mobile phone, tablet,
                    or personal computer. </p>
                <p>Depending on your condition, you may have been asked to read and imagine yourself in a series of
                    brief stories. In this active condition, the last word (or word fragment) gave almost all of the
                    brief stories a positive meaning. We expect this will encourage a more flexible and less negative
                    thinking style. In an alternative condition, which we do not expect to be as effective as the
                    active condition, you simply read about characteristics of anxiety.</p>
                <p>For some participants, if your early activity on the site suggested you might be at risk of dropping
                    out of the study, you may have been connected with a personal coach to support your participation
                    in the study. We expect that participants who had the opportunity to work with a coach will have
                    better outcomes than participants at risk for dropping out who did not work with a coach.  </p>
