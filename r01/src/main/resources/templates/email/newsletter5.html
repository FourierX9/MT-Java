                <p  style="margin-top:5px">
                    Having anxiety can feel like an isolating experience. Sometimes, it feels like no one thinks or feels the way you do.
                </p>

                <p  style="margin-top:5px">
                    It's important to know that you are not alone.
                </p>

                <p  style="margin-top:5px">
                    Additionally, it can be hard to talk about the experiences you've had with anxiety. There's still a lot of stigma
                    surrounding conversations about mental health. However, when people speak up about their mental health, it
                    can be very powerful. This can help us start having important conversations about mental health in our own life.

                <p  style="margin-top:5px">
                    Olivia Singh, a writer for <i>Insider</i>, recently wrote an article about celebrities that have opened up about their struggles with
                    mental health. Celebrities like Chris Evans, Dwayne Johnson, and Lady Gaga discussed their experiences and how they find
                    strength in coping with their mental health challenges.

                    An undergraduate research assistant in our lab, <b>Tylar Schmitt</b>, wanted to share her experience with anxiety and how she strives to reduce the stigma around anxiety in her everyday life.

                    "While I look incredibly happy in this picture, I was dealing with crippling anxiety.
                </p>

                <p  style="margin-top:5px">
                    For me, my anxiety felt like worrying about everything that ever happened to me and like everything I did was going to turn out horribly. In short, I was anxious pretty much all of the time.
                </p>

                <p  style="margin-top:5px">
                    I didn't realize until years after feeling anxious that I have generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). GAD is one of the many types of anxiety disorders and people with GAD tend to have lots of worries about a variety of things rather than something specific, like a phobia.
                </p>

                <p  style="margin-top:5px">
                    When I was in my first-year of college, I realized that the way I was living wasn't sustainable. So, I decided to get help. For me, that looked like getting in-person, individual therapy, and it was incredibly beneficial. While I still have days where my anxiety consumes me, I'm now able to take more control of my thoughts and reconsider unhelpful and untruthful beliefs that I have.
                </p>

                <p  style="margin-top:5px">
                    Here are some of the ways that I overcame the stigma of anxiety in my own life:
                </p>

                    <p  style="margin-top:5px">
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Talking with my support system.</b> For such a long time, I was quiet about my experience with GAD. Opening up to my family and friends about what I was going through helped me feel less alone. It also allowed my family and friends to gain a perspective that they weren't familiar with. </li>
                        <br/>
                        <li><b>Posting about anxiety on my social media.</b> When I reached the point where I felt comfortable sharing my experience, I posted about it as well as more general facts about anxiety. So much misinformation about mental health is shared online, so this was a way that I could take charge and educate people on what anxiety actually looks like.</li>
                        <br/>
                        <li><b>Engaging in self-care.</b> I try to engage in an act of self-care every day, whether that's playing a game of tennis with friends or painting my nails. There's a notion that self-care is selfish but it isn't. It's essential. Carving out time to care for myself helps me relax and be a better person for the people in my life.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>

                    <p  style="margin-top:5px">
                    For so long, I thought that I was alone in the way that I thought and felt. Now I know that I'm not and you aren't either. Anxiety can feel incredibly isolating, but I hope <b>you know that you are not alone.</b>"
