Your participation and your responses to the follow-up surveys will help us to make MindTrails even better for future participants. Ultimately, our goal is to create an accessible and cost-effective program that reduces symptoms of anxiety, and <b>your participation is very important</b> to us achieving that goal.</p>                <p  style="margin-top:5px">                    The MindTrails study consists of five training sessions. Each session lasts about 15-20 minutes, and you'll complete one per week for five weeks. While you can leave the study at any time, we encourage you to complete the study in full so that you can get the most out of the program.                </p>                <p  style="margin-top:5px">                    Two months after you complete the study, you will be asked to complete a survey. The purpose of the survey is to understand the long-term effects of the MindTrails program, and how people are managing their anxiety during this particularly challenging time with the coronavirus.                </p>                <h2 style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:10px">How does Mindtrails work?</h2>                <p style="margin-top:5px">                    MindTrails uses <b>cognitive bias modification (CBM)</b> to help you develop more flexible thinking skills.                </p>                <p style="margin-top:5px">                The picture below shows an example of one of the CBM scenarios in the MindTrails program.                </p>                <img src="../../static/images/newsletter/n1p1.png" th:src="${url} + '/images/newsletter/n1p1.png'"                     alt="Example CBM Scenario" title="MindTrails" style="display:block" border="0"/>                <p style="margin-top:5px">                    The way that we think is influenced by cognitive biases, which are patterns of thinking that relate to our emotional responses. Cognitive biases can determine whether we interpret a situation in a positive or negative way. Here's an example of cognitive biases in action:                </p>                <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%">                    Imagine that you're in line at a coffee shop. You see your neighbor off to the side, waiting for their coffee. You wave to your neighbor but they keep their head down, not waving back. Your mind instantly starts racing and you can't help but think that they're avoiding you.                </p>                <p style="margin-top:5px">                Much like the cognitive bias in this example, people with anxiety often assume a negative outcome, even though there is no evidence to suggest that to happen. Through repeated practice, CBM targets your cognitive biases to teach you how to interpret information in <b>more flexible, and less rigidly negative ways</b>.                </p>                <p style="margin-top:5px">                    As you start the MindTrails study, you may wonder why it’s set up the way it is.
