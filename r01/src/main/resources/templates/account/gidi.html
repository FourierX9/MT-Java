                <p>We are inviting some of our MindTrails visitors to participate in an additional study that is tracking
                    peopleâ€™s anxiety and the impact of COVID-19 over time. This additional study is entirely optional. If
                    you choose to participate, it will not change your activities in the MindTrails program except in the
                    following ways:</p>
                        <ol>You will complete 1 additional follow-up assessment (lasting about 20 minutes) 6 months
                            after you finish the MindTrails program.</ol>
                        <ol>Currently, we do not offer payments for completing the assessments, but we will be offering
                            gift cards for completing the assessments for persons who join this additional study. You
                            will receive:</ol>
                            <li>$5 for completing the assessment at the end of session 3 training</li>
                            <li>$5 for completing the assessment at the end of session 5 training</li>
                            <li>$15 for completing the assessment 2 months after you finish the MindTrails training</li>
                            <li>$15 for completing the assessment 6 months after you finish the MindTrails training</li>
                <p>You will receive the gift cards via email from Tango Card, where you can choose from top name-brands
                    like Amazon.com, Starbucks, iTunes, Target, and many more options, or you can donate the value to a
                    charity. To receive gift cards, you will need to verify your phone number. Your email address and
                    phone number will not be shared with third parties.</p>
                <p>All other MindTrails policies detailed in the original consent form are the same for this additional
                    study.</p>
