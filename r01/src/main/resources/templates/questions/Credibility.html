                <p><h3><b>About the Calm Thinking program</b></h3></p>

            <p> Calm Thinking involves five training sessions that are spread out over five weeks. You’ll complete one training session
                each week, and each session requires about 20 minutes to complete.</p>

            <p> Participants will be randomly assigned to different conditions
                because we are trying to figure out exactly what kind of training works best. Depending on your
                assignment, some people will be asked to do the training on their mobile phone, while other people
                will be asked to do it on their desktop or laptop computer. You’ll also complete some assessments as
                part of our research study so that we can evaluate how well the program works.</p>

            <p> In addition to your training sessions, you may be asked to work briefly with one of our coaches (via
                phone, email, or texts) who can address any questions you have and support your work in the program.
                Note that a small group of individuals will be asked to read some information about anxiety and then
                invited to complete the training sessions after the assessment period is over. At the end of the study,
                you will get feedback about how your anxiety symptoms have changed over the course of the program.</p>

            <p> This program is free to use. You can do the sessions anywhere, so long as you have access to a quiet
                place and the Internet.</p>
                <br/>

                <p><h3><b>So, how does Calm Thinking work?</b></h3></p>
      
            <p> In our program, we are helping you change the way you think about common but potentially
                stressful situations in order to reduce your anxiety. During each session, you will be asked to read
                brief stories and complete word fragments, by filling in one or more missing letters
                in a word. The task is not meant to be tricky or too difficult.</p>

            <p> These exercises are designed to help you change the way you make sense of emotional events by giving
                you lots of practice in responding to them in different ways. The program can feel a little
                repetitive, but <u>the repetition is important so you develop a new thinking style</u>. Don’t worry if you
                don’t use smartphones or computers much — the tasks are not designed to be difficult,
                and you can always email questions to the team at
                <a href="mailto:studyteam@mindtrails.org">studyteam@mindtrails.org</a>.</p>

            <p>This is an experimental program so it is still in the testing phase, but prior research suggests this
                program may be able to reduce anxious thinking as effectively as therapy for some people. We want to determine
                if it can be helpful for you. If you would like to learn more about the science behind Calm Thinking,
                take a look at the "Research Support" button at the top of the page.</p>
