about.title=About
about.heading=What Is the MindTrails Project?
about.what.p1=The MindTrails Project is a web-based, public research site that offers free interpretation bias training programs to promote healthier thinking patterns for people with anxiety and other emotional difficulties. Research shows that people prone to anxiety tend to think about situations negatively. MindTrails programs give you practice thinking about situations in new ways. This encourages more flexible thinking styles in your everyday life. Learn more  
about.what.link=about the science
about.what.p2=Developed by an interdisciplinary team of clinical psychologists, computer scientists, and engineers at the University of Virginia, MindTrails aims to efficiently test which training programs work best for different people and problem areas. We strive to continually improve these programs for the next generation. Our team is excited to learn whether these programs can help address the desperate need for greater delivery of care that has good research support.

faq.title=Frequently Asked Questions
faq.heading1=GENERAL QUESTIONS
faq.q1=1. I’ve completed some sessions and am still feeling anxious. Is the program not working for me?
faq.a1=Don’t give up! It can take time to learn how to use what you are learning in the sessions in your own life. It is important to keep completing the sessions and to honestly and accurately report your feelings throughout the program. You are helping us learn what works.
faq.q2=2. What if I miss a session? Can I do two the following week?
faq.a2=Try to complete one session each week. We will send you email reminders to help you remember when you should complete your next session. If you miss a session, complete it as soon as you have time (though we ask you to always leave at least one day between sessions).
faq.q3=3. Where and when can I do the sessions?
faq.a3=You can complete this program wherever and whenever you would like, as long as you have access to an Internet connection (through a smartphone, tablet, or computer). We strongly recommend that you complete the tasks when you are in a reasonably quiet place and able to pay full attention to them.
faq.q4=4. I have limited computer or smartphone skills. Can I still use this program?
faq.a4=Yes. Anyone with access to the Internet and an email address is welcome to use this site. If you can access your email and use an Internet browser, you have the skills needed to complete the study. No special skills are required. You will be asked to either click on your responses or type letters into boxes. Throughout the study, we will send you emails to update you on your progress and to remind you of upcoming tasks. You can also email us if you have any questions: studyteam@mindtrails.org.
faq.q5=5. Who created this program?
faq.a5=Researchers from the University of Virginia created these programs, but they were adapted from computer tasks that have usually been tested in research laboratories (see Hallion & Ruscio, 2011). As clinical scientists, we are interested in studying how well the programs work in the real world. In the long run, we want to create a cost-effective and accessible mental health treatment.
faq.q6=6. Is this really going to work for my anxiety?
faq.a6=This is an experimental program so it is still in the testing phase, but prior research indicates it may be able to reduce feelings of anxiety. Even if you are not assigned to the training task condition, you will be given the opportunity to complete it.
faq.q7=7. I’m already receiving treatment for my anxiety (e.g., taking prescriptions or seeing a therapist). Can I still use this program?
faq.a7=Yes, anyone that qualifies from the questionnaire is welcome to use this program. Before you begin, you will be asked a series of questions about your mental health – please let us know if you are already receiving treatment.
faq.q8=8. What devices can I use to complete the program? Can I switch devices depending on where I am?
faq.a8=This study is available on computer, smartphone, and tablet. Currently supported Internet browsers are: Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari. You are welcome to switch between devices over the course of the study (for example, if you start the study on your computer but go on vacation during one of the study weeks, you can do the study from your smartphone). Just make sure to know your login information (including your password).
faq.heading2=SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE PROGRAM
faq.q9=1. When answering questions (following each of the brief stories), the program keeps telling me that my answer is incorrect.
faq.a9=Please answer the questions based on information given to you in the stories. Remember that it is essential that you fully involve yourself as if the events described are really happening to you, so your answers should reflect that.
faq.q10=2. When trying to complete word fragments at the end of the brief stories, the program keeps telling me my answer is incorrect.
faq.a10=Please complete the word fragments based only on information given to you in the brief stories.
