                <p>The purpose of this part of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of a new, experimental
                    program to encourage healthy thinking about the future. It includes 6 15-minute sessions, completed
                    over the course of 1 week. You will be asked to complete a task in which you read brief stories,
                    answer questions, and complete word fragments by filling in one or more missing letters in a word.
                    Some of the stories will include an image in order to help you to imagine being in the
                    described situation.
                </p>

                <p>You can do the sessions anywhere, so long as you have access to a quiet place and a computer, phone
                    or tablet with Internet.
                </p>
