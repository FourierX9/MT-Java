                <p>Thank you for your interest in our research! </p>

                <p>The SAMMI Study includes 6 sessions of training over the course of one week. These training sessions
                    take about 15 minutes to complete, which also include some short assessments as part of our research
                    study so that we can evaluate how well the program works. At the end of the study, we’ll give you
                    feedback about how your thinking has changed over the course of the program.</p>

                <p>You can do the sessions anywhere, so long as you have access to a quiet place and a computer, phone
                    or tablet with Internet.</p>

                <h3>So, how does this training work? </h3>

                <p>In our program, we are attempting to help you change the way you think about common but potentially
                    stressful situations. During each session, you will be asked to read brief stories and complete
                    word fragments, by filling in one or more missing letters in a word. The task is not meant to be
                    tricky or too difficult. It is not a puzzle to try to solve.</p>

                <p>These exercises are designed to help you change the way you make sense of events by giving
                    you lots of practice in responding to them in different ways. <b>The program can feel a little repetitive,
                    but the repetition is important so you develop a new interpretation style.</b></p>

                <p>Don’t worry if you don’t use computers much—the tasks are not designed to be difficult and you can always
                    email us with questions at <a href="mailto:studyteam@mindtrails.org">studyteam@mindtrails.org.</a></p>

                <p><b>This is an experimental program so it is still in the testing phase, but prior research suggests
                    programs like this one may be able to reduce anxiety and other forms of distress as effectively as therapy for some people. We want to determine if
                    it can be helpful for you.</b></p>
