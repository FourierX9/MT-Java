            <p> The FutureThinking program includes 4 sessions spread out over the course of about 2 weeks. You will
                complete a session about every 2 days, and each session takes about 15 minutes to complete. You will also
                complete
                some assessments so we can evaluate how well the program works.
            </p>

            <p th:if="${participant.receiveGiftCards}"> You'll receive gift cards to thank you for completing the
                assessments, and a bonus gift card after completing the
                full study. You’ll also receive feedback after completing the full study about how your thinking about
                the future has changed
                over the course of the program.</p>

            <p th:unless="${participant.receiveGiftCards}"> You’ll receive feedback after completing the full study
                about how your thinking about the future has changed over the course of the program.</p>

            <p> You can do the sessions anywhere, so long as you have access to a quiet place and a device with
                Internet access.
                This program is free.
            </p>

            <p><b> How does FutureThinking work? </b></p>


            <p> In our program, we are attempting to change the way you make sense of information in order to alter
                your thinking about future. During each session, you will be asked to read brief stories and complete
                word fragments, by filling in one or more missing letters in a word. The task is not meant to be tricky
                or too difficult. It is not a puzzle to try to solve.
            </p>

            <p>These exercises are designed to change the way you make sense of information by giving you lots of
                practice
                responding to situations in different ways. The program can feel a little repetitive, but the <u>repetition
                    is important for developing a new interpretation style</u>.
            </p>

            <p>Don’t worry if you don’t use online interventions much—the tasks are not designed to be
                difficult and you can always email us with questions at <a href="mailto:studyteam@mindtrails.org">studyteam@mindtrails.org</a>
            </p>

            <p>This is an experimental program so it is still in the testing phase, but prior research says this program
                may be able to alter thinking styles as effectively as therapy for some people. We want to learn if
                it can be helpful for you.
