                <p>The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a new, experimental program to
                    encourage healthy future thinking. It includes four 20-minute training sessions, completed over
                    the course of two weeks (two sessions per week), and three 15-minute assessment sessions.
                </p>


                <i> You will be presented with one of a few different training programs. We are testing which
                    programs most effectively encourage healthy future thinking. Although our prediction
                    of which program will be most effective is based on previous research, we cannot
                    be sure our prediction is correct until we randomly assign people to each program and compare the programs' effects. If you get assigned to a program we do not think will be the
                    strongest, you will have the chance to complete the program we expect to be most
                    effective after you finish the study. In other words, <i>everyone</i> eventually gets a chance to try the program we
                    expect to be most effective.
                </p>

                <p>You will be asked to complete a 15-minute assessment before your first training session, after your
                    fourth training session, and one month after your fourth training session. The assessments will help us
                    track your progress and determine if this new program is effective.
                </p>

                <p> At different points in the study, you will be asked to complete questions about your thoughts, mood, background, and mental health history.
                    You will also be asked to complete tasks in which you read brief stories, answer questions, and complete word fragments. For some
                    participants, being asked questions about their thoughts and mood can be temporarily
                    distressing.
                </p>

                <p> At the end of the study, you will receive more detail about the studyâ€™s rationale and design.
                    You will also receive feedback about the progress you made during the program and how your
                    thinking about the future changed.
                </p>

                <p> There may be no direct benefits to you. Depending on your randomly assigned condition, you may
                    complete procedures that may help encourage healthy thinking about the future.
                </p>

                <p>Remember that participating in this study is voluntary. You may stop
                    participating in a given session at any time by closing the study window. Contact <a href="studyteam@mindtrails.org">studyteam@mindtrails.org</a> if you
                    have any questions about the study or would like to withdraw completely from the study.

                    (this can be your first name or any other name you choose), but your last name and mailing

                <p> Data collected through the MindTrails website are treated as confidential and are accessible only by the research team.
                    The only exceptions to this guideline are if we learn of
                    possible child abuse or neglect, or danger to self or others. In these instances,
                    confidentiality would be limited given mandated reporting requirements (e.g., to report the
                    information to the police, or to Child Protective Services).

                <p><b>Supported Technology.</b>  MindTrails is designed to work well with the latest versions of Google Chrome,
                    Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer.  In most circumstances these browsers update themselves
                    automatically; however, if you are using an older operating system such as OS X Mavericks (version
                    10.9) or earlier, or an Internet Explorer version lower than 8.1, you may encounter some issues. This
                    study can be completed on many devices, including desktop computers and most Android and Apple smart
                    phones and tablets. If you encounter any technical problems, please email us at
                    <a href="mailto:studyteam@mindtrails.org">studyteam@mindtrails.org</a>. Include as much detail as
                    possible about your chosen device, operating system, and web browser.</p>

                <p><b>Privacy Policy.</b> MindTrails uses the same secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS) that
                    banks and other commercial websites use to transfer credit card information in an encrypted
                    format. This provides strong security for data transfer to and from our website, though privacy
                    is necessarily limited by the security of the technology that is being used. To view the entire
